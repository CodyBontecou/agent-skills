# Frontend Design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Generates creative, polished HTML/CSS/JS that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Philosophy

This skill guides the creation of memorable, context-specific interfaces by committing to bold aesthetic directions rather than defaulting to safe, cookie-cutter patterns.

## Key Principles

- **Typography** — Distinctive, characterful font choices. No generic fonts like Arial or Inter. Pair a display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme** — Cohesive palettes with dominant colors and sharp accents. CSS variables for consistency.
- **Motion** — High-impact animations: staggered page load reveals, scroll-triggered effects, surprising hover states. CSS-first, Motion library for React.
- **Spatial Composition** — Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements, generous negative space.
- **Atmosphere** — Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, grain overlays.

## What It Avoids

- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, system fonts)
- Purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter designs lacking context-specific character

## Aesthetic Directions

Choose from flavors like: brutally minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, editorial/magazine, brutalist, art deco, Swiss grid, Memphis/80s, Bauhaus, cyberpunk, cottagecore, high-fashion, and many more.
